 Questions
1. Why is the fs core module important for Node development?
It is used to access the file system by the use of code. It is used for many important tasks such as creating directories, reading content of directories, creating and copying files.
is is the way in which it communicates with the directory and decides whether the code needs to have a synchronous or asynchronous method.

2. What is the difference between sync and non-sync methods in the fs module?
sync- code runs in sequential order, this means that it must wait for the current line of code to finish executing before moving to the next one.
non-sync- the code continues to run each line without waiting for it to finish executing. This is useful for information retrieved from other sites such as API's

3. Why are modules used?
independent modules are used to seperate the functionality of a program into smaller pieces. Each module contains whatever is needed to execute a part of the wanted functionality and each files is treated as it's own module.

4. Why are libraries such as fs used in Node programming?
they allow built-in modules within node to solve a lot of complex tasks without having to make completely new data for each thing. The libraries hold common information that is useful in many different applications.



Code Practice
Create a Github repo called simple-http-node-server. Create an HTTP server on port 3000 with a request handler that creates a file named hello-world.txt. You will be using the fs module to do this. Write the content: "Hello to this great world" to the hello-world.txt file. Please submit your finished code in your submission.
